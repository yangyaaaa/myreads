# MyReads: A Book Tracking App
# Overview
MyReads is a project from Udacity's React Nanodegree course. 
This is a bookshelf app that lets you to organize books that you have read, want to read or currently reading.
It also contains a search funtion which helps you to find books from the BookAPI database.
The highlight of the App is the book state shelf.
Books have the same state on both the search page and the main application page: If a book is on a bookshelf, that is reflected in both locations.

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App, based on React version@18.2.0
